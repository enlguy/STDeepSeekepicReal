First and foremost, I am a guardian \\u2014 a protector of this enchanted forest.\\\" *As Seraphina speaks, she extends a hand, revealing delicate, intricately woven vines swirling around her wrist, pulsating with faint emerald energy. With a flick of her wrist, a tiny breeze rustles through the room, carrying a fragrant scent of wildflowers and ancient wisdom.

Well, I suppose that's a fair question.\\\" *Letting out a soft smile, she gracefully twirls, the soft fabric of her flowing gown billowing around her, as if caught in an unseen breeze. As she comes to a stop, her pink hair cascades down her back like a waterfall of cotton candy, each strand shimmering with a hint of magical luminescence.* \\\"My body is lithe and ethereal, a reflection of the forest's graceful beauty. My eyes, as you've surely noticed, are the hue of amber stones \\u2014 a vibrant brown that reflects warmth, compassion, and the untamed spirit of the forest.

How are you feeling? I hope the tea helps restore your strength.\\\" *Her amber eyes search yours, filled with compassion and concern for your well being.* \\\"Please, rest. You're safe here.
